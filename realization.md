Realization (probability)

In probability and statistics, a realization, observation, or observed value, of a random variable is the value that is actually observed (what actually happened). 

The random variable itself is the process dictating how the observation comes out.

Statistical Quantities computed from realizations without deploying a statistical model are often called "empirical", as in empirical distribution function or empirical probability.

Conventionally, to avoid confusion, upper case letters denote random variables; the corresponding lower case letters denote their realizations.[1]

In more formal probability theory, a random variable is a function X defined from a sample space Ω to a measurable space called the state space. If an element in Ω is mapped to an element in state space by X, then that element in state space is a realization. (In fact, a random variable cannot be an arbitrary function and it needs to satisfy another condition: it needs to be measurable.) 

Elements of the sample space can be thought of as all the different possibilities that could happen; while a realization (an element of the state space) can be thought of as the value X attains when one of the possibilities did happen. 

Probability is a mapping that assigns numbers between zero and one to certain subsets of the sample space. 

Subsets of the sample space that contain only one element are called elementary events. The value of the random variable (that is, the function) X at a point ω ∈ Ω,

{\displaystyle x=X(\omega )}  x = X(\omega)
is called a realization of X.


The value that a random variable  X will take is, a priori, unknown. However, after we receive the information that  X has taken a certain value  x (i.e.,  $X=x$), the value  x is called the realization of  X. The concept extends in the obvious manner also to random vectors and random matrices.

Examples

Suppose we perform a probabilistic experiment having two possible outcomes,  $omega _{1}$ and  $\omega _{2}$. The sample space, that is, the set of all possible outcomes, is
	Ω = {w1, w2}

Now, suppose we have a random variable  X defined as follows:
	X(w) = x1 if w = w1 and x2 if w = w2
If the realized outcome of the experiment is  $\omega _{1}$, then the realization of the random variable  X is
	X(w1) = x1



--------------------------------

Empirical Probability, relative frequency, or experimental probability of an event is the ratio of the number of outcomes in which a specified event occurs to the total number of trials, not in a theoretical sample space but in an actual experiment.

In a more general sense, empirical probability estimates probabilities from experience and observation.

Given an event A in a sample space, the relative frequency of A is the ratio m/n. 
m - number of outocmes in which the event A occurs
n - total number of outcomes of the experiment.

In statistical terms, the empirical probability is an estimate or estimator of a probability.
