Joint Probability Definition

A joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time.

Joint probability is the probability of event Y occuring at the same time event X occurs.

What does Joint Probability Tell You?

Probability is the field of statistics that deals with the likelihood of an event or phenomena occuring. It is quantified as [0, 1], where 0 indicates an impossible chance of occurrence and 1 denotes that certain outcome of an event.

Joint probability is a measure of two events happening at the same time, and can only be applied to situations where more than one observation can occur at the smae time.

The symbol “∩” in a joint probability is referred to as an intersection. The probability of event X and event Y happening is the same thing as the point where X and Y intersect. 

Therefore, joint probability is also called the intersection of two or more events.

Joint Probability and Conditional Probability

Conditional Proabbility is the probability that one event will happen given another action or event happens. 

Joint probability only factors the likelihood of both event occuring.

Conditional Probability can be used to calculate joint probability.

P(X, Y) = P(X|Y)*P(Y) = P(Y|X)*P(X)

Statisticians and analysts use joint probability as a tool when two or more observable events can occur simultaneously. 

For instance, joint probability can be used to estimate the likelihood of a drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) accompanied by a drop in Microsoft’s share price, or the chance that the value of oil rises at the same time the U.S. dollar weakens.
