What are parameters?

Often in ML we use a model to describe the process that results in the data that are observed. For example, we may use a random forest model to classify whether customers may cancel a subscriptions from a service (known as churn modelling) or we may use a linear model to predict the revenue that will be generated for a company depending on how much they may spend on advertising.

Parameter define a blueprint for the model. It is only when specific values are chosen for the parameters that we get an instantiation for the model that describes a given phenomenon

Intuitive Explanation of Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum likelihood estimation is a method that determines values for the parameters of a model. The parameter values are found such that they maximize the likelihood that the process described by the model produced the data that were actually observed.
